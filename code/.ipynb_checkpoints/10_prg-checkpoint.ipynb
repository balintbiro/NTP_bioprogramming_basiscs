    "Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a very important programming paradigm that has many advantages and some drawback(s). At this point we were programming in a so called linear style. OOP is completely different and a very big topic so we will just check some of the core ideas.\n",
    "Classes are the base concepts of OOP and can be considered as some kind of templates. They have a key mechanism called instantiation. To instantiate a class you have to predefine a special function called constructor. Your PC sees your class through your constructor function. If you instantiate a class, that will result in an object (which is an instance). Inside your class you can define as many functions as you want but you can only use these functions through your class! This is the core concept of OOP, which requires an even more abstract way of thinking than the coding style we did before.\n",
    "The advantages:\n",
    "- increases readibility through structure simplification\n",
    "- code refactoring (when you change the structure of your code without changing the result of it) is easier if you have an OOP code\n",
    "- debugging is also easier with OOP\n",
    "- and more\n",
    "There is one really big drawback of OOP, you have to know exactly which is a proper case for using OOP. If you define a class for every little task that you have to perform, than your code is going to be a complete mess! There is a golden rule for OOP code, if you have just one function inside your class, that class is totally useless!\n",
    "Lets see a little illustration and hopefully after that it will make sense.\n",
    "To understand OOP, it is a good idea to think about a car assembly process. So you define a class which is a template for producing a car. This vehicle is a complex system (wheels, frame, glasses etc) so you should define the subprocesses (in our case, the functions will be our subprocesses). In pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car: #this is our class\n",
    "    def frame: #these are our functions (for each subprocesses which are strongly related to our car!)\n",
    "        'the base frame of our car'\n",
    "    def angine:\n",
    "        'add engine to the car'\n",
    "    def wheels:\n",
    "        'add wheels to the frame'\n",
    "    def glasses:\n",
    "        'add glasses to the car'\n",
    "\n",
    "Since most of the cars have the same parts, we can do different brands just by using our class (template).\n",
    "toyota=Car() #these are objects (instances) that were produced via instantiation from our class\n",
    "opel=Car()"
